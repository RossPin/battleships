#Battleships

An Implementation of the board game 'Battleships' built as a personal project during EDA bootcamp.

A 2 player game played on the same screen.

The aim of the game is to destroy all of the opposing players ships on a grid based board. Players take turns to stike the opposing payers board. Each strike is revealed as a hit or a miss. In order to destroy a ship all cells of the ship must be hit. Ships are between 2 and 5 cells long and 1 cell wide.

Players can be set as human or computer players.

If an opposing player is controlled by the compeuter the players ships will be visible on the screen.

If an opposing player is a human the players ships will be hidden untill destroyed.
